I'm a Ph.D. student of Population Health Sciences with emphasis on Biostatistics at the University of Utah. My research interests are precision medicine, dynamic treatment regimes, and causal inference. My dissertation topics are:
1. Generating decision rule for treatment initiation without genetic testing for patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,
2. Developing optimal individual treatment rules for first- and second-line treatments for patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and
3. Landcaping proteoms across different stages of metatstic prostate cancer.
