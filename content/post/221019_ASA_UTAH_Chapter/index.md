American Statistical Association (ASA) Utah Chapter got together in person for the first time in 3 years! They didn't have an annual meeting due to COVID. I am not a member yet, but Jincheng, one of my committee members, is a Treasurer of the Utah chpater, so I decided to go. 

The topics were on data science. It clarified some of confusing terms about data science. Data scientists use all scientific inquiry, math & stat skills, and coding skills to answer importnat questions.

The two speakers talked about 
1. Data scientist, itâ€™s role and significance UTAH chapter president
2. Applan itermountanin: presentation on intermountain and what data scientist can do
Promising career.
